Dice Map
=====

## Why it exists

A friend of mine recently wished on facebook for a program that would process an image of Dice
scattered on a table into a D&D world map. So I made it.

## What it does

It takes an image of dice scattered on a table and outputs the basic shape of a world map based on
how the dice are scattered.

## What it does not do

- Name your countries, cities, oceans or anything
- draw borders for countries or place cities or any landmarks of any kind
- look good really

## Usage

TBD
